#### Algorithm


Keep in place algorithms that I found useful for implementation

* JS algorithms and DOM related
* Closure as I understand it
* Object.prototype as it is
* HTML5 playground

####Important knowledge for FE

* prototype - inheritance in js, how it differs from other languages
* scoping - functions as first class objects, closures, function vs block scoping
* AJAX - just general stuff, how you've used it, etc, not really super technical questions here
* Web Security - same origin policy, Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery, cookies (secure flag, http only flag, what to store in cookies, what not to, etc), basic session based security
* REST API design - given a random data model that I come up with on the spot, design a good API for it
* Troubleshooting techniques - race conditions, developer tools (firebug, chrome dev tools, windows script debugger), understanding that breakpoints affect the behavior of your code, proxy tools (Fiddler or the like), understanding that proxies can affect the behavior of your code (fiddler mishandles edge cases of content-encoding chunked, as an example), wireshark or similar
* code organization and dependency management - what do you do, are you familiar with AMD/require.js, commonjs, or es6 modules?
* Array functions - map/reduce/filter/reduce/sort/etc
* new ES6 features - not make-or-break, but it's good to know, babel transpiler experience also good.
* build tools - webpack, grunt, etc
* server side js - node.js, npm experience
* currently popular frameworks/libraries
