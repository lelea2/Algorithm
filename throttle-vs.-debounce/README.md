```
Throttling enforces a maximum number of times a function can be called over time. As in "execute this function at most once every 100 milliseconds."

Debouncing enforces that a function not be called again until a certain amount of time has passed without it being called. As in "execute this function only if 100 milliseconds have passed without it being called.

* Throttling a button click so we canâ€™t spam click
* Throttling an API call
* Throttling a mousemove/touchmove event handler
* Debouncing a resize event handler
* Debouncing a scroll event handler
* Debouncing a save function in an autosave feature

```
# Debounce
const debounce = (func, delay) => {
  let inDebounce
  return function() {
    const context = this
    const args = arguments
    clearTimeout(inDebounce)
    inDebounce = setTimeout(() => func.apply(context, args), delay)
  }
}

```
# Throttle
const throttle = (func, limit) => {

      inThrottle = true
      setTimeout(() => inThrottle = false, limit)
