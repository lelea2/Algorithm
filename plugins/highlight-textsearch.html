            <p>JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. The overwhelming majority of
        modern websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, game
        consoles, tablets, and smart phones—include JavaScript interpreters, making Java-
        Script the most ubiquitous programming language in history. JavaScript is part of the
        triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content
        of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify
        the behavior of web pages. This book will help you master the language.</p>
        <p>If you are already familiar with other programming languages, it may help you to know
        that JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped interpreted programming language
        that is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles. JavaScript
        derives its syntax from Java, its first-class functions from Scheme, and its prototypebased
        inheritance from Self. But you do not need to know any of those languages, or
        be familiar with those terms, to use this book and learn JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The name "JavaScript" is actually somewhat misleading. <span>Except</span> for a superficial syntactic
        resemblance, JavaScript is completely different from the Java programming language.
        And JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become
        a robust and efficient general-purpose language. The latest version of the language (see
        the sidebar) defines new features for serious large-scale software development.</p>

            var e = document.getElementById("searchtext").innerHTML;
            var enew = e.replace(/(<span>|<\/span>)/igm, "");
            document.getElementById("searchtext").innerHTML = enew;
            var newe = enew.replace(query, "<span>$1</span>"); //replace current query with span div for highlighted
            document.getElementById("searchtext").innerHTML = newe;
