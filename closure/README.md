### JS closure

Playing with closure in JS

Definition:
- a closure is a function, along with all variables or functions that were in-scope
- a closure is implemented as an “inner function”;
  Eg:, a function defined within the body of another function.
- An important feature of closures is that an inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables.
