#### 1. List out the differences between LESS and Sass?

LESS
– LESS uses JavaScript and processed at client-side
- Variable names are prefaced with the @symbol
- LESS does not inherit multiple selectors with one set of properties
– LESS does not work with “unknown” units neither it returns syntax error notification for incompatible units or maths related syntax error

Sass
– Sass is coded in Ruby and thus processed to server-side
– Variable name are prefaced with $ symbol
– Sass inherits multiple selectors with one set of properties
– Sass allows you to work with “unknown” units also returns a syntax error notification for incompatible units
